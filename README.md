# ACM-Cup-Distributed-GIS-Case
Analyzing Hot Spot and Zones for Taxi Pickups Using Apache Spark

This project required analyzing taxi pickup location data to analyze high density areas in NYC. The analysis is done on spatial temporal data using Apache Spark and Scala. This assignment is taken from ACM GISCUP 2016 competition. The primary goal was to perform two tasks: hot zone analysis and hot cell analysis.	For Hot Zone Analysis, the task involved identifying the density of points (pickups) within specific geographic zones (rectangles). For Hot Cell Analysis, the focus was on calculating relative density of geo-graphic areas

This project is done for ASU MCS **CSE 511 - Data Processing at Scale** final project
